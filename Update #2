Update 2

The following changes have been made to the website:

1. The Home page has now been completed! We have added two external sites and two internal redirects in the website, for our guides and career choices for those interested in cyber security or IT in general. The last page has bls.gov on Cyber Security for more information about that industry.
2. The About page has been updated to talk about us as a team. We've also added our images, though the last one is just Ringo Starr. I just felt like adding the 4th member to be ironically the last member of The Beatles. It fits too.
3. Our Tutorials page has been given more posts to work with! Thanks to my team, we were able to get the needed guides/articles created along with videos embdedded

Hurdles

Currently, there aren't any major hurdles. I would say the only thing needed now to work on would be the finalization of our infographics on Canva.

Alternatively, we can also look into adding more panels about who we are as individuals, but that's up to the team overall to decide. If we went through it, it will lower our productivity score of how far we are in the project, but it shouldn't be that big of an impact overall. It's just a thought, but a thought nonetheless. I can always have the other members provide brief, 3-5 sentence paragraph about who they are and what they like, in conjunction with why they like the field they're in.

Thoughts

Honestly, the project has been super smooth sailing since the last update. The design update was the biggest hurdle we've had, but once I got the rhythm down and got the pages uniformed, the process of adding things has dropped the amount of time needed to add posts. It's been great!
