Update 1 

The following changes have been made to the website:

1. The website has added a Guide, Infographics, and About Page.
2. The main page of the website has been changed to best fit the modern look of a cybersecurity website, using a dark background for better visibility.
3. Video elements have been added. The current element in Wix only allows 4 videos to be added, unless you were to purchase the full version to increase it up to 10 elements.
4. Guides have been made, but these are still placeholder guides until the ones submitted by a fellow teammate can update them.
5. Infographics page is empty, but once we receive the Canva infographics, they will be updated to best fit the site.

Hurdles

We are working on making the website accessible, yet allow it to maintain a consistent design that allows all the other guides and media to fit seamlessly without worry of sections breaking apart.

Currently, the hurdle is being worked on as I gather comments and critiques on the layout on the website by my peers and use the feedback given to further improve the website's layout. The following feedback may need to be addressed:
      - The home page is too cluttered with many elements and may need to remove stuff such as the About. Considering the fact there's already an About Page, this is a doable request.
      - Keep the video section, but move it to the bottom or to the Guide page
      - Remove the Blog posts as that will also be in the Guide page
      - Add a specific section at the bottom that can talk about assisting the end users, divided into separate columns about: one for job guides, one for the video guides (which would then lead to the Guides page), and other considerations of that nature

Thoughts

This site is becoming a bigger investment than originally thought. In no way is that bad. It's a testament to the passion brought regarding this topic! As we work on the project, the more I am happy to say this will help us learn more about the field or give us a sense of what we would like to do in our future career paths.
