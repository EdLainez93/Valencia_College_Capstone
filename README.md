Description:

We are an IT consulting and blog site called "Why So Secure" - a fun, yet serious blog and consulting website that is best used to assist and provide guidance to our audience with securing their Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as their routers, IoT enabled devices, and computers. We provide on our website, through Wix, infographics, tutorials, and guides and news articles detailing the importance of securing your network and devices. We run our infographics through Canva, an online presentation web application that enables us to provide the necessary tools to import to our website. 

Through GitHub, we will be uploading our Gantt Chart progress througout the semester as we provide our progress in the tools being used. As we work through the website, we will be using Microsoft Project as the tool to manage and monitor our project. 

Eduardo Lainez will work with creating the website, using Wix to not only assist in creating the website, with using the templates as prototypes, but to allow Wix to host it. The link to the website is here: https://elainez62.wixsite.com/why-so-secure. As he works through developing the site, he will monitor the entire project using Microsoft Project, updating, modifying, or increasing the overall scope of the project based on the feedback from his teammates.

Cristhian Torrealba will be working in creating the infographics as well editing the website for a better user experience. He will be handling the guides and how readers will be able to understand the terminology used from the guides and tutorials for accessibility purposes.

Saul Barragan will not only handle the video tutorials, but will also assist in the website development by providing the resouces such as internal and external guides along with Cristhian. During these times, for every upcoming presentation, Saul will assist in handling the video presentation and assist with the Git commit and pushes into the GitHub. Each of the members will be having access to the Wix website and assist with the Gantt Chart, which will also be uploaded here. We will use Teams to best communicate with one another and provide daily updates for each time spent on the project.
