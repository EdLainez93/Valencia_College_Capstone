Update #3

The following changes have been made:

With the website at its finalization, the team has went ahead and began assisting me with getting some minor touches made to the overall site. We have added some additional content with minor summaries for the videos to perfectly encapsulate what the video is about for the end user.

With regards to the About Page, that too has been completed at 100% with all our photos, including Ringo Starr, now being up and corrected. 

My personal favorite was the Infographics page that my teammates have created. They've all been exceptionally well made. They've all been added to the website and our Gantt Chart shows the progress now at 100% all across the board for everything. Our GitHub has now been finalized as the updates, while sporadic, have been meaningful in updates.
We have implemented all the necessary changes per each and every update. So now, the only thing left is to publish the website via Wix. 

-- Hurdles --

There have not been any hurdles in regards to this creation in this update. Unless you were to count personal issues, the lack of hurdles has been astounding. The more we worked on it and made concise effort, the less struggles were had in the websites overall creation.

-- Thoughts --

I'm legitimately proud of my team for all their hardwork as we made this website work out! Despite the early on struggles and anxiety over the lack of some assistance with one our members, us three were able to pull ahead and work it all without their assistance. They have not been made a member of this team and will not receive any credit for these projects.

Kudos to Cristhian Torrealba, Saul Barragan, and myself for a job well done!
